This week, I will begin working with [Cover](http://paywithcover.com) as a product designer. I'm very excited for the opportunity to join a startup in its infancy. More on this later, but first, some thoughts on my previous partnership [space150.](http://space150.com)

#### A reflection on the past three years with space150

space150 houses an awesome bunch of people. It was a privilege to be surrounded by so many smart, driven, and passionate young professionals each day. Shedding the branding of the agency every 150 days and starting anew enabled space150 to explore many design styles and technical advancements. Above all, I'll never forget the culture and the people.

##### Highlights with space150 include:

-	Picking up my life and moving from Minneapolis to Brooklyn.
-	Regularly presenting design to multiple business units within American Express and meeting some very sharp folks in the process.
-	Juggling 12+ projects at once, typically mixing up the names of them.
-	Spending 2 weeks at space150 LA working with Forever 21, America's Next Top Model, and Tyra Banks.
-	Hanging out with the crew at Version Parties and the "space150 Olympic Special" (Founder, Billy Jurewicz's birthday bash).

These are great memories and experiences. I'll miss the folks at space150.

#### Back to Cover

Cover creates a seamless payment experience specifically designed for dining&mdash;it lets you pay at restaurants without waiting for the check. This solves a problem that has plagued me for years. Waiting for the bill is an awkward end to an evening. It gets even more awkward if your server isn't around, or you're out with 22 people and need to split the check 22 ways (how uncouth). 

Cover aims to solve these issues with minimal app interaction. After all, you're out for an evening of fun&mdash;you shouldn't need to fiddle with your phone too much.

#### In Closing

Leaving space150 was a tough choice, however, I can't tell you how excited I am to help build and improve a product from private beta, to launch, and iterations thereafter. 

More to come on the progress. NYC folks, ping me if you want to beta test Cover.
